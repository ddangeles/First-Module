# Module 01 Submission

Module 01: Refactoring style.css and index.html with semantic html and changing the css to fit the semantic elements. The elements followed a logical struture that was independent of styling and positioning. All icons and image elements have accesible alt attributes. The heading attributes fall in sequential order and there is a concise, descriptive title.
